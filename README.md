# Hearing-aids-for-impaired-people
In this project, the simulation of simple digital hearing aid was developed using MATLAB programming language. The implementation of this configurable digital hearing aid (system includes the noise reduction filter and amplitude amplifier). This digital hearing aid system is design to adapt for normal and moderate hearing loss patient.

In this Repository i am adding all the files of my project and you can run the end1 file to get output of the wave forms in which i provided but you can also use a project.m file to run as alive script and there are no waveforms indicated for that as such be cautious....

The reason why i am asking you to run the end1.m file is that the output of my file is composed in a single line and i have divided my code into many matlab files as such you cannot run every file because you get error so i have compiled everything into a single line of code in end1.m file but it is different for project.m file because i have divided every section in the code itself rather than dividing it into files.
